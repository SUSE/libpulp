# Wrapper around pexpect.spawn that automatically sets userspace livepatching
# requirements, such as LD_PRELOAD'ing libpulp.so, as well as extends its
# functionality with live patching operations.
#
# Using this testing framework requires few steps: importing this module,
# starting a live patchable process, optionally testing its default behavior,
# applying a live patch, and testing the patched behavior, for instance:
#
#   # Import the testing framework:
#   import testsuite
#
#   # Start the target process:
#   child = testsuite.spawn('testcase')
#
#   # Check default behavior:
#   child.send('ping')
#   child.expect('pong')
#
#   # Apply a live patch
#   child.livepatch('metadata')
#
#   # Check patched behavior:
#   child.send('ping')
#   child.expect('pang')
#
# The 'livepatch' and 'expect' methods are the main interfaces to the testing
# framework. Simply calling them is usually enough, because they check for
# error conditions on their own. However, if more control over the outcomes is
# needed, they raise exceptions which can be caught and dealt with. See the
# existing test cases for examples.
class spawn(pexpect.spawn):

  # Spawn a live patchable process. Similar to pexpect.spawn, this class
  # constructor starts and controls a child process. Unlike pexpect.spawn,
  # LD_PRELOAD=libpulp.so is automatically provided, unless 'env' is passed as
  # an argument. The arguments: 'timeout', 'env' and 'encoding' are forwarded
  # to pexpect.spawn; whereas log is assigned to pexpect's logfile_read
  # attribute. Finally, 'verbose' controls whether the live patching methods
  # print messages to stdout. By default, all messages are printed, so that the
  # test suite logs contain more information for debugging.

  # comprehensive information about the scanning status, such as the whole
  # child output, as well as less relevant information about the child process.
  # Even though the output is useful, it pollutes the test suite logs
  # unnecessarily. Thus, this class overrides expect() and always adds
  # pexpect.EOF and pexpect.TIMEOUT to the list of expected patterns, so that
  # it can print less verbose, more targeted information, when the original
  # expected patterns and the actual output do not match. If it happens, the
  # overridden method raises exceptions for EOF and Timeout, which have the
  # added benefit of displaying local, shorter, and more friendly stack traces.
