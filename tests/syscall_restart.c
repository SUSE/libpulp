  /*
   * When a thread that is in the middle of a syscall receives a signal,
   * the syscall gets interrupted. On some occasions, such as when there
   * are no handlers registered for the signal, or when the SA_RESTART
   * flag is in effect (see sigaction(2)), the kernel arranges an
   * automatic restarting of the syscall to happen when the thread is
   * rescheduled, and it does so by subtracting one instruction from the
   * program counter.
   *
   * Notice, however, that the subtracting happens only immediately
   * before the rescheduling, and it can't be easily detected from a
   * tracer, such as gdb or libpulp's tools. The tracer sees a program
   * counter that points to the next instruction after the syscall,
   * i.e.: it doesn't see the subtraction.
   *
   * Now, since libpulp hijacks the target process, modifies the
   * program counter of a selected thread, and asks the kernel to resume
   * execution; the subtraction mechanism could be consumed, and the
   * actual restarting of the syscall could be lost. If that happens,
   * programs that do not handle syscall interruption would break.
   * Besides, even if the change in behavior would not be catastrophic,
   * it would make live patching less transparent.
   *
   * The following program intentionally exits in error if the read
   * syscall is not restarted.
